        <h3>Report </h3>
        <p>This report contains the value computed using the model for each sample, element pair, as long as the data needed to calculated that value was present in the input sheets.
        If the data was not available the sheet will be empty at that location. </p>
        <h3>Full Detailed Report </h3>
        <p>This report holds all information regarding the calculation of the model used to calculate a given sample element pair.
        If a value is enclosed by *, as in *3.14159265*, then that value was not used on the calculation of the weighted mean 
        for that element sample pair. If a value reads -1.0, NaN, or null, then the relavent information was not present
        in the data set or during creation of the model. 
        If the sheet id blank at any points, this indicates that the input sheet was lacking information about the element in question.</p>
