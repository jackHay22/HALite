    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <p>- All tables must be surrounded by a starting #table_name and ending #END, where
        table_name can be any name you'd like to use to identify that data. Anything outside of
        these tags will be ignored. </p>
        <p>- Holes in your datasets are handled automatically by the system.</p>
        <p>- Column names in your datasets are also handled automatically, so changing them is
        unnecessary.</p>
      </div>
    <h3>System formatting errors</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <p>- Make sure that all names for elements, standards, and unknowns, are consistent throughout
        your datasets. The most common issue when starting a new project is inconsistent naming between
        files, so this should be the first thing you check. </p>
        <p>- Another common mistake is using files from different runs. Make sure that the files you use are always from the same run. </p>
